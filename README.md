The result shows that Random Forest algorithm (predicted accuracy of boosted model: 0.933) outperforms Logistic Regression (predicted accuracy of boosted model: 0.930) on this Psychedelic Mushroom (PM) Use dataset which contains various types of independent variables, such as demographic features (sex, age, ethnicity, etc.), health and well-being condition, socioeconomic conditions, and previous knowledge about PM. 

Both boosted models which incorporate the factors of "previous knowledge about PM" outperform the baseline model (lr model: 0.930 vs 0.928; rf model: 0.933 vs 0.930). Furthermore, the key features of importance shift towards "previous knowledge about PM" after the inclusion of these factors ("Psy2_no_knowledge_of_use" ranked 1st in the lr boosted model; "Psy1_knowledge_of_positive_use" and BMI both ranked 1st in the rf boosted model).
